SYNOPSIS
  collect-config.sh [-l|--list-orphans] [-r|--remove-orphans]
                    [-d|--diff [-R|--revision <rev>]]
                    [--collect-config] [--check-permissions]
                    [--check-packages] [--check-links]
                    [-?|-h|--help] [-v|--version]
DESCRIPTION
  collect-config.sh uses a configuration file in Bash Syntax. This
  file helps to keep track of the configuration which differs from
  the system's default. Once a day all files which are part of
  COLLECTION will be copied and checked in to the repository. This
  makes it possible to keep track of changes.
  Collect-config can also maintain a list of installed packages. It
  will warn when a package is not installed or differs from the named
  version. With the PACKAGE list it is easy to install all needed
  packages if a reinstall is requiered.
  Collect-config can also check for soft- and hardlinks as well as
  the right permissions on files.
  If called without any arguments collect-config.sh will copy and
  check in all COLLECTIONs. It will check if all PACKAGEs are installed,
  it will check if all SOFTLINKs and HARDLINKs exists and it will
  check if all PERMISSIONs and ownership are set as configured.
